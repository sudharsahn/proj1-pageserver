# README #

A "getting started" project for CIS 322, introduction to software
engineering,  at University of Oregon.

### What is this repository for? ###

The objectives of this mini-project are:

  * Experience with GIT workflow with separate configuration:  Fork the project, make and test changes locally, commit;  turn in configuration file with reference to repo. (Project 0 is practice for this part.) 
  * Extend a tiny web server in Python, to check understanding of basic web architecture
  * Use automated tests to check progress (plus manual tests for good measure)

### What do I need?  Where will it work? ###

* Designed for Unix, mostly interoperable on Linux (Ubuntu) or MacOS. May also work on Windows, but no promises.  A Linux virtual machine may work, but our experience has not been good; you may want to test on shared server ix-dev.

* You will need Python version 3.4 or higher. 

* Designed to work in "user mode" (unprivileged), therefore using a port 
  number above 1000 (rather than port 80 that a privileged web server would use)

* Windows 10 note: The new Windows bash on ubuntu looks promising.
  If you are running Windows 10, please give this a try and let me
  know if the Ubuntu/bash environment is suitable for CIS 322
  develpment. 

### Assignment ###
* Fork this repository to create your own repository on Github.  (Read the 'git' documentation as needed, and create an account on Github if you don't have one. You should've already done finished this as part of Project 0.) 
* Clone your repository onto the machine you want to work on.
* Add the following functionality. (a) If URL ends with name.html or name.css (i.e., if path/to/name.html is in document path (from DOCROOT)), send content of name.html or name.css with proper http response. (b) If name.html is not in current directory
Respond with 404 (not found). (c) If a page starts with one of the symbols(~ // ..), respond with 403 forbidden error. For example ,  url= localhost:5000/..name.html or /~name.html would give 403 forbidden error.
* Make and test your changes.  Use both automated tests (the script in
the 'tests' directory) and some manual tests.
* Revise this README.md file:  Erase what is no longer relevant and 
  add identifying information. If you have concerns about adding your email ID, let the instructors know.

* Copy the credentials-skel.ini file to credentials.ini, then edit it
  to contain correct information including your github repository
  URL.  credentials.ini should NOT be under version control (exclude
  it using your .gitignore file)
* Commit and push ALL your changes to github (except those not under 
  revision control)
* Test deployment in other environments.  Deployment 
  should work "out of the box" with this command sequence: 

  ~~~~
  git clone <yourGitRepository> <targetDirectory>
  cd <targetDirectory>
  make install
  make run
  ~~~~
  *test it with a browser now, while your server is
  running in a background process*

  ~~~~
  make kill 
  ~~~~
  
* Alternatively, use the script under "tests" folder to test the expected outcomes in an automated fashion. It is accompanied by README file and comments (inside tests.sh) explaining how to test your code.
* Check and revise your "credentials/credentials.ini" file.  My
  grading robots will read this. Be precise. My grading robots
  are not very good at guessing what you meant to write.
* Turn in the credentials.ini file in Canvas.  My grading robots will
  use this file to access your github repository.   

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Maintained by Ram Durairajan, Sudharshan Srinivasan and Guangyi Tao
* Use our Piazza group for questions. Make them public (anonymous or not as you prefer) unless you have a good reason to make them private, so that everyone benefits from answers and discussion.
